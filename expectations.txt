I expect to learn the basics and hopefully master the essential skills in 
web development. Particularly, I expect to gain proficiency in foundamental 
languages relating to web programming such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript as 
it was barely touch on in previous courses. As the course progresses, I look 
forward to learning new topics that would widen my understanding in web 
programming as a whole. And by the end of the sem, use all of these learnings 
in creating the project requirement.

I hope to further hone my skills in web programming as well and be able to
create more visually appealing and functional web programs.
